## Brand Family Definitions

### ZKPIP™

ZKPIP™ is the umbrella project brand.  
It defines minimum viable standards for zero-knowledge proof validation and interoperability across proving systems.

### ProofSet™

ProofSet™ is the canonical JSON schema format for packaging and validating zero-knowledge proofs.  
It replaces fragmented representations with a unified, interoperable standard.

### SwiftSeal™

SwiftSeal™ provides lightweight validation for single proofs and small batches (1–9 proofs).  
It is designed for fast, efficient checks without requiring heavy infrastructure.

### SwiftSeal+™

SwiftSeal+™ extends SwiftSeal™ with paid support for medium-sized batches (10–100 proofs).  
It runs on light infrastructure, offering scalable proof validation at low cost.

### BatchSeal™

BatchSeal™ delivers enterprise-grade validation for large proof batches (100+).  
It leverages heavy infrastructure to provide reliable, high-throughput verification for mission-critical workloads.

### CodeSeal™

CodeSeal™ is a community badge for developers adopting and contributing to the ZKPIP™ ecosystem.  
It represents alignment with the standard and recognition within the open-source ZK community.

### SealScan™

SealScan™ is the official explorer portal of ZKPIP™.  
It enables developers, auditors, and end-users to search, view, and verify ProofSet™ records and associated Seals.

### ErrorGuide™

ErrorGuide™ is a structured knowledge base of common proof errors and interoperability issues.  
It helps developers navigate failures across proving systems, promoting reproducibility and shared learning.

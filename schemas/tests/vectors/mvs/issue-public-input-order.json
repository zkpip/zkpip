  "symptom": "Verification fails when public inputs are provided in a different order than expected by the verifier/circuit binding.",
  "suspectedLayer": "verifier",
  "category": "proof-verification",
  "severity": "major",
  "occurrence": "recurrent",

  "reproSteps": [
    "Generate a valid Groth16 proof for a circuit with two public inputs [a, b].",
    "Call the verifier with inputs in the expected order (a, b) → verified = true.",
    "Swap the public input order (b, a) while keeping the same proof → verified = false."
  ],
  "knownFix": "Normalize and enforce a canonical public input ordering (ABI-level schema), or bind inputs by name/index consistently across circuit, prover, and verifier."

## About the name: “ZKPIP” (dual meaning)

**ZKPIP** can be read in two ways:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Interoperability Project** — the open-source initiative and umbrella repository you are reading.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Improval Proposal** — the planned proposal format (similar to Ethereum’s EIPs or Bitcoin’s BIPs), which will define and standardize ZK-related specifications.

This dual meaning is intentional: the **Project** exists to host tools and schemas, while the **Proposals** define long-term community standards.

> Documentation related to **CanVectors** may be licensed under **CC BY 4.0**.  
> Test vectors themselves are governed by the **CanVectors ToS** (see `docs/terms/canvectors-tos.md`).

## Brand Family Definitions

### ZKPIP™

ZKPIP™ is the umbrella project brand.  
It defines minimum viable standards for zero-knowledge proof validation and interoperability across proving systems.

### ZK Trust Chain™

ZK Trust Chain™ is the end-to-end trust narrative of ZKPIP™.  
It spans **ProofEnvelope™ → Seals (VectorSeal™, SwiftSeal™, BatchSeal™, CodeSeal™, BridgeSeal™) → ScanSeal™**, creating a reproducible, auditable, and verifiable chain of trust for zero-knowledge proof validation.

### ProofEnvelope™

ProofEnvelope™ is the canonical JSON schema format for packaging and validating zero-knowledge proofs.  
It replaces fragmented representations with a unified, interoperable standard.

### CanVectors™ (Canonical ZK Vectors)

CanVectors™ is the **canonical, signed** set of zero-knowledge **test and demo vectors** curated by zkpip.org.  
Each vector is distributed with a **signed manifest** and **SHA-256 checksums** to ensure authenticity and integrity.  
CanVectors are intended for **testing, demos, CI validation, and interoperability research** — **not** for production security decisions or real-world risk assessment.  
Re-distribution must **preserve signatures and hashes**, and must **not** claim “official/canonical” status unless served directly by zkpip.org.

### VectorForge™

VectorForge™ is the official distribution portal for CanVectors™, hosted under **vectorforge.zkpip.org**.  
It provides access to vector manifests and artifacts (e.g., `verification.json`), along with metadata and indexes.  
The VectorForge **service and implementation may be proprietary**; the public specification for manifests and verification is open.  
Mirrors must clearly state they are **mirrors** and must preserve original signatures/hashes.

### VectorSeal™  _(new)_

VectorSeal™ is the governance seal for **vectors and packs**.  
It is issued only to artifacts that (a) comply with canonical schemas, (b) pass adapter verification, and (c) are **reproducible** per public instructions.  
Sealed vectors are indexed in **CanVectors™** with checksums and metadata.

### CircuitSeal™  _(new)_

CircuitSeal™ is the seal for **circuit artifacts** (e.g., ZoKrates/Noir/Circom sources).  
It binds circuit content to a **canonical circuithash** and a manifest, enabling downstream proofs to reference a trusted circuit origin in CI/CD and audits.

### ProofBridge™

ProofBridge™ is the ZKPIP™ interoperability layer that enables conversion of proof formats across ecosystems.  
It ensures proofs generated by one proving system can be understood, tested, or verified by another, bridging fragmented toolchains.

### BridgeSeal™

BridgeSeal™ is the ZKPIP™ seal that certifies proof conversions performed through ProofBridges.  
It creates a verifiable lineage between the original artifact and the converted artifact, ensuring auditability and trust in cross-system conversions.

### SwiftSeal™

SwiftSeal™ provides lightweight validation for single proofs and small batches (1–9 proofs).  
It is designed for fast, efficient checks without requiring heavy infrastructure.

### SwiftSeal+™

SwiftSeal+™ extends SwiftSeal™ with paid support for medium-sized batches (10–100 proofs).  
It runs on light infrastructure, offering scalable proof validation at low cost.

### BatchSeal™

BatchSeal™ delivers enterprise-grade validation for large proof batches (100+).  
It leverages heavy infrastructure to provide reliable, high-throughput verification for mission-critical workloads.

### CodeSeal™

CodeSeal™ is the developer-facing seal for **CI/CD policy compliance**.  
It attests that proof validation, adapters, and vectors have passed gate checks within a software delivery pipeline.

### ScanSeal™  _(renamed from SealScan)_

ScanSeal™ is the universal explorer that **indexes all Seals** (Vector/Swift/Batch/Code/Bridge).  
It enables developers, auditors, and end-users to search, view, and verify ProofEnvelope™ records and associated seals.

### ErrorGuide™

ErrorGuide™ is a structured knowledge base of common proof errors and interoperability issues.  
It helps developers navigate failures across proving systems, promoting reproducibility and shared learning.

### CrossProof Validation™

CrossProof Validation™ is the ZKPIP™ standard for validating proofs across multiple proving systems simultaneously.  
It provides unified assurance in multi-ecosystem scenarios, ensuring portability and comparability of cryptographic guarantees.

### ZKPIP Sealed™  _(new)_

ZKPIP Sealed™ denotes a **commitment-based sealing mode** for **private** artifacts:  
the public record contains hashes (or a Merkle root) and minimal metadata, allowing owners to prove authenticity **without disclosing** the underlying content.

## Guidelines for Use

1. **Fair Use in Reference**  
   You may use these names when referring to the ZKPIP™ project, provided such use does **not** imply endorsement, sponsorship, or official partnership.

2. **Open-Spec / Closed-Service**  
   Specifications (e.g., manifest format) may be open. Services (e.g., **VectorForge**) may be **proprietary**; this document does not grant rights to service code.

3. **Authenticity & Integrity (CanVectors / VectorForge / Seals)**
   - Use vectors **only** with a **signed manifest** issued by zkpip.org; **verify** the manifest signature and all **SHA-256 checks** before use.
   - Do **not** modify vectors or manifests; if you redistribute, **preserve** original signatures and hashes.
   - Do **not** rebrand redistributed copies as “**canonical** CanVectors” or imply they originate from zkpip.org.
   - For Seals, reference the **ScanSeal™** explorer URL (or manifest) when asserting sealed status.

4. **OSS Compatibility / Derivatives**  
   Use of the names in open-source forks, adaptations, or academic papers is permitted if it is clear the project is a **derivative** and **not** the official ZKPIP™ project.

5. **No Misrepresentation**  
   Do not use these names in a way that could mislead users into believing your project, product, or service is officially maintained, supported, or endorsed by ZKPIP™.

6. **Commercial Use**  
   Any commercial use (e.g., offering services, training, or products under these names) requires **prior written permission** from the maintainers.

7. **Naming & Presentation**
   - Use the exact, unaltered marks (e.g., **VectorSeal™**, **CircuitSeal™**, **ScanSeal™**).
   - Avoid pluralizing, hyphenating, or combining marks with other terms in a way that creates a new brand.
   - Use “™” on first prominent use; repeating the symbol on every occurrence is not required.

8. **Domains / Repositories**  
   Do not register domains or names that may cause confusion (e.g., “canvectors-official.example”).  
   Mirrors or forks must include clear disclaimers and links back to **zkpip.org**.

9. **Scope & Warranty**  
   CanVectors are for **testing and demo** only; no warranties or SLA. You are responsible for safe and compliant use.

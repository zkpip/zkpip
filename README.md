# ZKPIP – Zero-Knowledge Proof Improvement Proposals

This repository defines the core framework and governance for ZKPIP –  
a system of structured improvement proposals aimed at standardizing the zero-knowledge ecosystem.

## Purpose

The goal of ZKPIP is to:

- Establish a common vocabulary and classification for ZK proofs, errors, tools, and ecosystems.
- Provide a reference structure for tooling and developers working across fragmented ZK stacks.
- Serve as the foundation for catalogs such as `error-catalog`, `ecosystems`, and future specs.

## Structure

Each ZKPIP follows a structured proposal format with an ID, scope, and rationale.

Related repositories (initially private):

- [`zkpip/error-catalog`](https://github.com/zkpip/error-catalog): Standardized ZK error codes.
- [`zkpip/zktools`](https://github.com/zkpip/zktools): Dev tooling using ZKPIP codes.
- [`zkpip/lab`](https://github.com/zkpip/lab): Internal tooling to discover and validate ZK-related anomalies.
